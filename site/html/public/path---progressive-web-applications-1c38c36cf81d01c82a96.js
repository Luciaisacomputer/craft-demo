Specifically, it’s the way that web browsers on desktop and mobile devices will now <em>grant their native-application powers to websites</em>.</p>\n<p>Chrome and Firefox users on Android and Windows (yes, on the desktop!) have had <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=serviceworkers">access to these features for some time</a>. Now that they’ve been released to iOS, those Progressive Web Application superpowers will quickly be <em>everywhere</em>!</p>\n<p>And that means opportunities for you.</p>\n<h2>What can my site do once it’s a Progressive Web App?</h2>\n<p>Once your site is running over a secure connection and you’ve added two pieces of code, you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make your website available offline.</li>\n<li>Make your site run just as quickly over 4G as it does over wifi.</li>\n<li>Get your site onto users’ home screens <em>without</em> putting them through the app-store process.</li>\n<li>Did we mention the app store process? While you’re at it, you can save yourself the three weeks of hair-pulling since you won’t need app-store approval.</li>\n<li>Do all of the above using a <em>web</em> tools, using <em>web</em> skillsets, on a <em>web</em> budget and a <em>web</em> timeline. All managed in <em>just one code base</em>. Think how simple your Trello boards will get!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Soon, PWAs will be able to access Bluetooth. That will completely reshape how the Internet of Things works with the average user. <em>And that’s just getting started.</em></p>\n<h3>Sound Interesting? Join us at the Philly PWA Meetup!</h3>\n<p>Maybe you’re a business stakeholder that wants to know how using Progressive Web Apps can reduce the cost of developing applications. Maybe you’re a product owner that dreams of releasing features with just one developer team instead of three. And maybe you’re a developer that wants to play with the big new box of toys that PWAs provide. Please join us at the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PWA-Philly/">Philly Progressive Web App meetup</a>, and let’s explore what’s possible together!</p>',frontmatter:{author:"John Young",tags:["PWA","tools and apps","technology"],title:"All Your Dreams Came True Overnight With Progressive Web Applications",date:"March 30, 2018"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/progressive-web-applications/",previous:{fields:{slug:"/the-last-mile-in-website-security-usability/"},frontmatter:{title:"The Last Mile in Website Security: Usability"}},next:null}}}});
